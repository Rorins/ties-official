# About The Project

https://ties-official-dpy6tidvt-aurora268.vercel.app/

This fullstack application gives you the chance to chat with random listeners in difficult times.

You get to choose your own avatar, subscribe to the site and chat in real time.

Two roles are possible: listeners and people that want somebody to listen.
